## Assign a directly of html files

- You can assign your local directly as a root of webpage by adding ```-v `pwd`:/var/html``` option to `docker run` command.
- Or, you can configure it through Kitematic.

## Set a host name

- By adding a record to `hosts` file, you can host your testing page like `https://yourdomain/` (local only)
- A path to the hosts file is `/etc/hosts` on Linux and Mac, `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows.
- Add a line like `127.0.0.1        test.example.com`, then try to access `https://test.example.com/` through your browser.
